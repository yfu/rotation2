There are lots of binding sites that are predicted using computational method (by looking for motifs) but in experiments they are not always found bound by TFs. One possible explanation is that some parts of the genome is not accessible. They may have NARs (nucleoid associated proteins) wrapped around the those regions. These NARs may have similar functions with histones.
      1	  2    3  4	  5	6    7	 8	   9	 10	       11
TF1   _	  _       _	  x	_    _	 _	    	  	       _
TF2   x	  x    _  x	  x	_    _	 _	   x	 x	       x
TF3   x	       _  x	  _	_    _	  	   _	 x	       x

Why are regions not bound even they have the pattern for the TF?
(underscore means there is a computationally predicted binding site; and 'x' means that they are binding sites found in the experiment.)

LSR2 (Rv3597c) may behave like histones.

Genome View software program can provide a pileup view of different features.



There may be different views toward the explanation, from sequences and evolution.

For the rotation, just look for possible correlations from the view of sequences. Like, there may be other binding sites nearby that are bound by other factors. It is also possible that there are spatial interactions. Another possibility is that there are differences of GC contents.

lsr2 = Rv3597c
